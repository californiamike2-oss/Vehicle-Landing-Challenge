        <strong>CUSTOMER PROFILE:</strong><br>
        "Meet "Elena"
The Devoted Urbanite

The Profile: Elena is a 34-year-old freelance graphic designer who recently "totaled" her beloved Toyota C-HR. She is devastated because she adored its edgy, "transformer-like" styling and how easy it was to whip into tight downtown parking spots. She’s now in the market for a replacement, but she’s feeling stuck.

The Conflict: Elena’s life has changed slightly since she bought her last car; she’s now doing more "prop styling" for her photo shoots, which means she's constantly hauling bulky backdrops, light stands, and vintage furniture. While she loved her C-HR, she remembers the frustration of the tiny rear windows (which she called "portholes") and the fact that she had to "Tetris" her gear into the trunk because of the sloping roofline.

The Constraints:

Size Phobia: Her brother suggested a RAV4, but she immediately shot it down. To her, the RAV4 feels like a "mom-tank"—too bulky for her lifestyle and too hard to park in her apartment’s narrow garage.

Tech Aversion: She is adamant about no hybrids. She mistakenly believes that a hybrid means "another thing to plug in at night," and she doesn't have a charger at her complex. She wants a traditional gas engine that she can "just gas up and go."

The Look: She wants something that doesn't look "boring" or "generic," but she secretly needs more visibility and actual trunk space for her growing business."
